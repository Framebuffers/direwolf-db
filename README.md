# 🐺 direwolf-db

Docker container with a PostgreSQL database, Prisma ORM and a blank Node app template.

## 📂 Schema

Wolfpack's format follows the following schema:

- `id`: autoincremental integer key.
- `documentName`: the equivalent of `Document.Title` of a RVT file. Describes the name of the document as shown on the title bar.
- `fileOrigin`: the file path to the RVT file. Blank if it has never been saved or if it is workshared.
- `documentVersion`: a GUID generated by Revit for every time a Document has been saved. It is used to track the evolution of a Revit project, and it can be used to check differences (a _delta_) between two different savestates.
- `wasCompleted`: true if the test was completed successfully.
- `timeTaken`: time between the `Hunt()` method execution and the time the Wolfpack is being pushed to the `WolfpackDB`.
- `createdAt`: timestamp generated when the Wolfpack has been created.
- `guid`: unique identifier generated by Direwolf for each Wolfpack.
- `resultCount`: count of Prey objects inside of the Wolfpack.
- `testName`: name of the query.
- `results`: a JSON string containing each serialised Prey object.

## 📃 To do
